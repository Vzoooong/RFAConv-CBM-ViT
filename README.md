# RFAConv-CBM-ViT: Enhanced Vision Transformer for Metal Surface Defect Detection

This repository contains the implementation of the RFAConv-CBM-ViT model, a Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced with Receptive-Field Attention Convolution (RFAConv) and Context Broadcasting Median (CBM) modules. This model is designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of metal surface defect detection, addressing the challenges of high variability and sample imbalance commonly encountered in this field.
